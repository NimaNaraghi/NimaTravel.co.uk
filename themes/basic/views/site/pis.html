is likely to help us to realize that whether our proposed approach opens a new
window to the future of travel planning which is more efficient and less
burdensome. However, this is your choice. Please be assured that the research
is anonymous, confidential and voluntary.</p>

conferences and in subject-appropriate media. In all instances, no names or any
